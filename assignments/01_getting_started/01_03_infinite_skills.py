# If I had infinite programming skills, these are three projects I would build:

# 1. A golf stats tracker that records my games, shows my scores,
#    and helps me improve over time.
#
# 2. A personal finance app that connects to my bank and shows my
#    spending in clear graphs, so I know where my money goes.
#
# 3. A simple game where you can build a city and fight off monsters,
#    just for fun and creativity.
