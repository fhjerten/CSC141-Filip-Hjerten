#This poem This poem, called The Zen of Python, gives advice about how to write good code. It says that code should be clear, simple, and easy to read. For example, “Beautiful is better than ugly” means that code should look neat, not messy. “Simple is better than complex” shows that programmers should try to make things easy instead of hard.
# It also reminds us that mistakes should not be ignored, and that guessing in unclear situations is dangerous. There should be one clear way to solve a problem, even if it’s not obvious right away. The lines about “now is better than never” mean that it’s good to act, but not too fast if you don’t understand.
# Finally, it says that if code is hard to explain, it is probably a bad idea. If it’s easy to explain, it’s more likely to be good. The last line, about namespaces, is a joke but also serious: organizing code well is very important.
