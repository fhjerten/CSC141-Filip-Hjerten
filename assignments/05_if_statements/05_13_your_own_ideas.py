# These are the ideas that I have

# 1) Golf score tracker:
#    A tiny app that stores my rounds, shows average score,
#    and maybe graphs fairways hit/putts so I can see progress.

# 2) Study flashcards:
#    Type terms + definitions, then a quiz mode that shuffles cards
#    and tracks which ones I miss so I can review them more.

# 3) Simple game:
#    Start with tic-tac-toe or a number guessing game to practice
#    turns, input, and basic game logic.

# 4) Data practice:
#    Play with sports or weather datasetsâ€”load a CSV, compute
#    simple stats, and print a short summary report.

# 5) Small web page/app:
#    A basic site that shows my golf stats or study progress.
#    Keep it simple at first: read data and display it cleanly.
